# 1) Problem & Outcome
**Problem:** Buying a decorated phone case is either too generic (pre‑made) or too technical (3D configurators that feel sterile). People want the joy of making something themselves—like a craft table—without friction.

**Outcome:** A web experience where anyone can quickly assemble a DIY case by placing "trinkets" (stickers/charms) onto a guided case template, hit the minimum build requirement, and check out. Feels playful, handmade, and shareable.

**Primary KPI(s):**
- Builder → Checkout unlock rate (placed ≥3 trinkets): ≥ 65%
- Checkout → Purchase conversion: ≥ 25% (first month target)
- Avg. trinkets per case: 5–9
- Share/Save events per builder session: ≥ 20%
