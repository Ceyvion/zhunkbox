# 2) Concept & Brand Vibe
**Creative Direction:** DIY / zine / craft‑table, not glossy sci‑fi.
- Hand‑cut letterforms with confetti dots (inspired by resin letters image).
- Case = clear plastic pane with dashed placement guides (punched‑hole feel).
- Trinkets = sticker chips: thick black outline, slightly wonky, drag‑gable.
- Optional "Glitter" overlay toggle (spinning sprinkles layer).
- Micro‑copy feels scrappy and friendly ("Tape to Checkout").

**Out of Scope (v1):** Photoreal 3D rendering, phone‑model switching UI, user‑uploaded images, account system.
